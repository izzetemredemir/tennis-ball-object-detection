## Python tennis ball object detection with oop implementation. School project with opencv

I developed tennis ball tracking project with using OOP concepts I use opencv for image
processing and pyqt5 for interface. After that I implemented it for Raspberry pi and use GPIO pins.
Deployment on Raspberry pi can be harder than pc because of additional libraries of project
requirements.

## Raspberry Pi Implementation:
There is a raspberry pi folder in project folder.
There are 5 region represented by a led. In raspberry pi implementation turns on led which
represents region of the tennis ball.
